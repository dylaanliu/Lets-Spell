# Let's Spell
Grade 12 Android App Sumative Project

An Android App spelling game where the player is asked to spell a series of ten words.

The player can choose from varying difficulties (different lengths of words). Once the quiz starts the word will be recited using text to speech. From there the player will be given a couple of letters to choose from. Each incorrect spelling will deduct from your total score. After spelling all ten words your overall performance will be displayed on the final screen.
